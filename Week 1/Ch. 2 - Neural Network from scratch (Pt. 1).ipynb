    "This notebook aims to show students the inner workings of a basic neural network while at the same time iluminating some theoretical foundations that underpin machine learning in general. This work is inspired by [Trask's 'A neural network in 11 lines of Python'](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).\n",

You can find excel implementations in the week 1 folder. Open the excel sheet and see how the python code corresponds to the formulas in Excel. You can also use the sheets to explore what exactly happens to the parameters of the network as it trains."

    " That does not look like $y$ at all! That is just random numbers! We now have to modify the weights so that we arrive at better predictions.\n",
    " In order to arrive at better predictions, we first have to quantify how badly we did. In classification the metric used is the [cross-entropy loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy), sometimes also called logistic loss or log loss. It is calculated as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    " $$L(w) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=0}^m [y_i * \\log \\hat y_i  +  (1-y_i)*\\log(1-\\hat y_i)]$$\n",
    " \n",
    " Let's go through this step by step.\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. $L(w)$ is the loss function given the weights $w$ that where used to obtain the prediction $\\hat y_i$\n",
    " 2. $-\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=0}^m$ The loss over a batch of m examples is the average loss of all examples. We have factored a - out of the sum and moved it in front of the equation.\n",
    " 3. $y_i * \\log \\hat y_i$ This part of the loss only comes into play if the true value, $y_i$ is 1. If $y_i$ is 1, we want $\\hat y_i$ to be as close to 1 as possible, to achieve a low loss.\n",
    " 4. $(1-y_i)*\\log(1-\\hat y_i)$ This part of the loss comes into play if $y_i$ is 0. If so, we want $\\hat y_i$ to be close to 0 as well.\n",

    " $m = 1$, the true value $y_i = 1$ and the the prediction $\\hat y_i = 0.01$. $\\hat y_i$ can be interpreted as the probability that $y_i = 1$ given $X_i$, or $P(y_i = 1 | X_i)$ in math terms. It will never be zero since the probability of $y_i = 1$ will never be zero, only very small. Here, our algorithm has given $y_i = 1$ only a 1% chance. In the case above our loss can be calculated as: \n",
    " \n",

Since there are so many trees, you can not see the valley, you can only see the ground under you. How would you find your way down? One sensible approach would be to follow the slope of the mountain. Where the slope goes downwards, you go. This is the same as a gradient descent algorithm does. The loss function is the mountain and to get to a low loss, the algorithm follows the slope, that is the derivative, of the loss function. When we walk down the mountain, we are updating our location coordinates. The algorithm updates the parameters of the neural network.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this chapter you have built your first (very simple) neural network from scratch. You have seen some of the most important tools like backpropagation and gradient descent. In the next chapter we will build a bigger network with more layers. You will also learn about your first hyper parameter, the learning rate $\\alpha$.\n",

    "1. A NN makes predictions through matrix multiplication and activation functions.\n",
