    "# Ch. 17 - NLP and Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to week 4! This week, we will take a look at natural language processing. From Wikipedia:\n",
    "> Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While last week was about making computers able to see, this week is about making them able to read. This is useful in the financial industry where large amounts of information are usually presented in form of texts. Starting from ticker headlines, to news reports, to analyst reports all the way to off the record chit chat by industry figures on social media, text is in many ways at the very center of what the financial industry does. In this week, we will take a look at text classification problems and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentiment analysis with the IMDB dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is about judging how positive or negative the tone in a document is. The output of a sentiment analysis is a score between zero and one, where one means the tone is very positive and zero means it is very negative. Sentiment analysis is used for trading quite frequently. For example the sentiment of quarterly reports issued by firms is automatically analyzed to see how the firm judges its own position. Sentiment analysis is also applied to the tweets of traders to estimate an overall market mood. Today, there are many data providers that offer sentiment analysis as a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, training a sentiment analysis model works just like training a binary text classifier. The text gets classified into positive (1) or not positive (0). This works exactly like other binary classification only that we need some new tools to handle text.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common dataset for sentiment analysis is the corpus of [Internet Movie Database (IMDB)](http://www.imdb.com/) movie reviews. Since each review comes with a text and a numerical rating, the number of stars, it is easy to label the training data. In the IMDB dataset, movie reviews that gave less then five stars where labeled negative while movies that gave more than seven stars where labeled positive (IMDB works with a ten star scale). Let's give the data a look:"

Now, only God himself is capable of answering the question \"why in Gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie?\" Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie, for it lives up to more than that. As i attempted to sit though it, i noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie (with the exact same occurrences) any better? honestly, i would never suggest buying this movie, i mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.\n"

    "Computers can not work with words directly. To them, a word is just a meaningless row of characters. To work with words, we need to turn words into so called 'Tokens'. A token is a number that represents that word. Each word gets assigned a token. Tokens are usually assigned by word frequency. The most frequent words like 'a' or 'the' get tokens like 1 or 2 while less often used words like 'profusely' get assigned very high numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can tokenize text directly with Keras. When we tokenize text, we usually choose a maximum number of words we want to consider, our vocabulary so to speak. This prevents us from assigning tokens to words that are hardly ever used, mostly because of typos or because they are not actual words or because they are just very uncommon. This prevents us from over fitting to texts that contain strange words or wired spelling errors. Words that are beyond that cutoff point get assigned the token 0, unknown."

Previously, we have dealt with categorical data by turning it into one hot encoded vectors. But for words, this is impractical. Since our vocabulary is 10,000 words, each vector would contain 10,000 numbers which are all zeros except for one. This is highly inefficient. Instead we will use an embedding. \n",

Remember that neural networks work by calculating the derivative of the loss function with respect to the parameters (weights) of the model. Through backpropagation we can also calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to the _input_ of the model. Thus we can optimize the embeddings to deliver ideal inputs that help our model. \n",
